# pytest-project-template
This is a simple skeleton for tests using python and pytest.

No, you cant "run" it.  Most of the files are just placeholder BUT it can give you an idea on how you might want to organize
your testes, since this is a burning question of ever new tester that face the challenge to start a new testing approach.

This might not be pythonic (PR are appreciated), but sure it's a good base to do your own thing.
