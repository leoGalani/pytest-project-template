# pytest-project-template
This is a simple skeleton for tests using python and pytest.

No, you cant "run" it most of the files are just a placeholder BUT if can give a idea on how you might want to organize
your testes, since this is a burning question of ever new tester that face the challenge to start a new testing approach.

This might not be pythonic (PR are appreciated) but sure is a good base to do your own thing.
